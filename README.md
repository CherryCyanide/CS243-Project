Easy Rescheduling: For a planner application, a feature that allows you to easily reschedule an event or appointment without having to delete the original and recreate the whole event would be beneficial. It would save the time it takes to completely refill all the information for the new date. Instead, it would directly transfer the data for the original event on the original date to the new date and delete the original date's event. With just this feature you can guarantee your new schedule will be fixed and accurate. It would be clear that this feature was properly implemented, if you are able to successfully transfer the information without any data loss. 

Repeatable Events: Similar to the feature of easy rescheduling, this feature relies on data transfer. However, instead of transferring one date and deleting the original, this would allow you to repeat the same event and its data over several days. Doing so, you could either choose specific days you want the event to repeat, or you could set it to repeat every week on the same day. This prevents having to reenter the same information repreatedly for regularly occuring events. You would know this feature was implemented if you can duplicate events across multiple days without any data loss.

Add People to Events: This feature would allow you to assign contacts or profiles to an event, so that you can keep track of who is participating. This helps keep information together in a simple way, and if added through contact, allows easy communication about the event. You could even implement a way to send a link to the connected contacts to add the event to their own calendar. You would know if this feature was applied because the people profiles would exist in the event, and have a phone number attached if it were added to the event as a contact.
