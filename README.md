Get events for certain day: It wouldn't be a good planner app if you couldn't get what events you had for the day. Likely the most essential part of any planner app, the ability to know what you have going on on any given day is essential for well, planning. By storing dates in a three part address, the month, the day, and the time, it would be easy to quickly retrieve whatever events you have on a given day by finding the address.

Easy Event Creation: Creating events should be easy. All you need is a date and a time. Unfortunately a smooth user experience is harder than you might think to get right.

Easy Rescheduling: For a planner application, a feature that allows you to easily reschedule an event or appointment without having to delete the original and recreate the whole event would be beneficial. It would save the time it takes to completely refill all the information for the new date. Instead, it would directly transfer the data for the original event on the original date to the new date and delete the original date's event. With just this feature you can guarantee your new schedule will be fixed and accurate. It would be clear that this feature was properly implemented, if you are able to successfully transfer the information without any data loss. 

Repeatable Events: Similar to the feature of easy rescheduling, this feature relies on data transfer. However, instead of transferring one date and deleting the original, this would allow you to repeat the same event and its data over several days. Doing so, you could either choose specific days you want the event to repeat, or you could set it to repeat every week on the same day. This prevents having to reenter the same information repreatedly for regularly occuring events. You would know this feature was implemented if you can duplicate events across multiple days without any data loss.

Add People to Events: This feature would allow you to assign contacts or profiles to an event, so that you can keep track of who is participating. This helps keep information together in a simple way, and if added through contact, allows easy communication about the event. You could even implement a way to send a link to the connected contacts to add the event to their own calendar. You would know if this feature was applied because the people profiles would exist in the event, and have a phone number attached if it were added to the event as a contact.

Event Duration and All-Day Events
This feature lets users choose how long an event lasts by setting a start time and end time, or by marking it as an all-day event. Not every event fits into the same time slot, so this makes scheduling more realistic. All-day events should show separately from timed events so they don’t make the schedule look cluttered. This feature is complete when events can have different lengths, all-day events can be toggled on or off, and the schedule shows the correct times and durations.

Event Categories and Sorting
This feature allows users to assign a type to each event, such as work, school, personal, or appointment. Users can then filter their schedule to only show certain types of events or sort them in a useful order. This helps keep the schedule organized and easier to read, especially on busy days. This feature is complete when events can be categorized and the schedule correctly updates when filters or sorting options are applied.

Event Location and Description
This feature adds extra details to events, including a location/address and a short description or notes section. This allows users to store important information directly inside the event instead of remembering it separately. The details should be editable and saved with the event. This feature is complete when the location and description can be added, edited, and still appear correctly after reopening the event.
