This file contains date assistant functions. Functions include: Determining the day of the week that 
a given date falls on, Returning the name of a weekday, Returning the name of a month, Returning the 
3-letter abbreviated name of a day or a month. Also, a function to return the corrct suffix for a 
number, like "st" for "1st", "nd" for "2nd", and so on.  

Included in the source file is a debug test rig that accepts command line arguments and calls all 
the functions.  Also in the file are instructions and Web links for compiling the code and linking 
via the Java Native Interface or the Java Native Access library, both which allow Java programs 
to call native code routines. By this method, Java can call functions included in any compiled 
object file or library, allowing Java to interface with any other compiled language.
